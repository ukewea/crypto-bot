## Installation & Setup

### Quick Start (Dynamic Data Loading)

1. Navigate to the dashboard directory:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard/crypto-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd server && npm install && cd ..
   ```

3. Start both servers (API backend + React frontend):
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173`

The dashboard will now **automatically load your actual asset position data** from the `asset-positions/` folder!

### Manual Setup (Individual Servers)

If you prefer to run servers separately:

1. **Start the API server** (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the React app** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Production Deployment

```bash
npm run build              # Build React app
npm run start:full         # Run both servers in production mode
```

## Configuration

### Dynamic Data Loading

‚úÖ **SOLVED!** The dashboard now automatically reads your actual asset position files!

**How it works:**
1. **Node.js API Server** (`server/index.js`) runs on port **39583** and reads JSON files from `../../../asset-positions/`
2. **File Watching** automatically detects changes to your position files
3. **Real-time Updates** when your trading bot updates positions
4. **Automatic Refresh** button to manually reload data

**Supported files:** BTC.json, ETH.json, ADA.json, DOGE.json, SOL.json, SUI.json, XRP.json (and any new assets you add)

### Asset Position File Format
The dashboard expects JSON files with this structure:
```json
{
  "open_quantity": "0.00056",
  "open_cost": "64.0764680000000", 
  "realized_gain": "0.0",
  "total_commission_as_usdt": "0.0",
  "transactions": [
    {
      "time": "1755611608285",
      "activity": "BUY",
      "symbol": "BTC",
      "trade_symbol": "BTCUSDT",
      "quantity": "0.00008",
      "price": "115239.81000000",
      "commission": "0.0",
      "commission_asset": "USDT",
      "commission_as_usdt": "0.0",
      "round_id": "1755611608134542533",
      "order_id": "11276951932476010528",
      "trade_id": "13329001597177739616",
      "closed_trade_ids": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Trading Bot

The dashboard is designed to work seamlessly with the crypto trading bot:

2. **Real-time Sync**: Updates as new transactions are recorded
3. **Consistent Data Format**: Uses the same JSON structure as the bot
4. **No Interference**: Read-only access to position data

## Port Configuration

### Changing the API Port

You can easily change the backend port using environment variables:

**Method 1: Using .env file (Recommended)**
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file and set:
VITE_API_PORT=12345

# Then run normally
npm run dev:full
```

**Method 2: Using environment variables directly**
```bash
# Both frontend and backend will use port 12345
VITE_API_PORT=12345 PORT=12345 npm run dev:full

# Or use the convenient script
PORT=12345 npm run dev:port
```

**Method 3: Backend only (‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended)**
```bash
# This only changes backend - frontend won't connect unless you also set VITE_API_PORT
PORT=12345 npm run dev:full  # ‚ùå Won't work - frontend still connects to 39583

# Correct way:
PORT=12345 VITE_API_PORT=12345 npm run dev:full  # ‚úÖ Works
```

**Available Scripts for Custom Ports:**
- `npm run dev:port` - Runs both servers with $PORT environment variable
- `npm run start:port` - Production mode with custom port

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No data showing**: Check that asset position files exist in the expected format
2. **Charts not displaying**: Ensure Recharts is properly installed and imported
3. **Styling issues**: Verify Tailwind CSS is configured correctly
4. **TypeScript errors**: Check that all types are properly imported and defined

### Development Tips

- Use browser developer tools to debug data loading issues
- Check the console for any error messages
- Verify that the asset data structure matches expected TypeScript interfaces
- Test with different screen sizes using responsive design tools
